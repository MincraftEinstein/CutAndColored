### **📘 Description**
Welcome to Cut And Colored. This mod aims to add vanilla feeling blocks to the game. Along with some new workstations(the glasscutter, the sawmill, and the weaver) to help create these new blocks. We are always looking to improve the mod, so if you have any ideas that fit well with the mod and Minecraft feel free to suggest them.
