If anyone likes the Stonecutter, then you'll like this mod, because it adds three new blocks like the Stonecutter. The Glasscutter used to make glass stairs and slabs. The Sawmill used to make wood stairs and slabs and the Weaver, it's like a real-life loom, used to make wool stairs and slabs. The Stonecutter has some new recipes like terracotta stairs and slabs. Colored Redstone lamps are also here! as well as stained planks!
